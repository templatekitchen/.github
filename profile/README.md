# Template Kitchen

This GitHub org is an initiative by [ricardobalk][]. The goal is providing somewhat advanced, ready to use template repositories, that can be forked and used without many changes.

One of the examples is the [nuxt3-tailwindcss repository][], which can be forked easily by clicking on the "Use this template" button, and could then be deployed and assigned to domain names via Vercel without much hassle.

## Contributions

This is an open kitchen. All contributions are welcome, so if you found something useful, don't hesistate to send it. Happy hacking!
